The volume and \nvalue of data used in everyday business increasingly informs how organisations operate and how \nsuccessful they are. In order to protect this information —and to be seen to be protecting it — \nmore and more companies are becoming  ISO 27003  certified.\n\nThe main drivers for security are undoubtedly globalisation, government  directives, regulatory  \nrequirements, terrorist activities and escalating cyber threats. Furthermore, organisations  \nseeking contracts with governments or large corporate clients are increasingly  finding ISO 27001 \nis a prerequisite  for doing business.\nCertification is seen as a powerful assurance  of your commitment to meet your obligations to \ncustomers and business partners.\n\nThis situation is all the more pressing with the advent of the EU General Data Protection \nRegulation (GDPR), which requires businesses to secure the personal data of all EU residents, and \nhefty fines (up to 4% of plobal annual turnover or €20 million, whichever is the greater) can \nresult from serious data breaches.\nWhile the GDPR offers no specific guidance to ensure the protection of data, ISO 27001 offers a set \nof specifications that describe the features of an effective information security management system \n(ISMS).\n\nWe realise that pursuing the right certification for your organisation can be overwhelming, \nparticularly because there are so many variations. These variations are sometimes renamed or \nsuperseded by newer standards, which can cause  some confusion. The purpose of this paper is to \nhelp you understand ISO 27001 certification and explore the benefits of following the information \nsecurity rules set by governments.\n\n•     What is ISO 27001? How does this standard help organisations more effectively manage their \ninformation security?\n\n•     What is the relationship between ISO 27001 and ISO 27002?\n\n•     What is the value of ISO 27001 certification?\n\n•     How do these standards relate to ISO  9001?\n\n•     What does someone need to know to initiate, or take on responsibility for, an organisational \ninformation security project — specifically one intended to lead to ISO 27001 certification?\n\nThis paper, written by ISO 27001 expert Alan Calder, answers these basic questions and more. It \nalso points to online resources and tools that are useful to anyone tasked with leading an \ninformation security project. The information in this paper\nis suitable for organisations of all sizes, in all sectors, anywhere in the world. More guidance \nand information is available from our ISO 27001 page.\n\nIT GOVERNANCE                        JANUARY 2018\n\n\nIT governance  and information security\n\nThe last few years have seen corporate governance requirements become increasingly more defined and \nspecific. Information technology has become more pervasive — underpinning  and supporting almost \nevery aspect of the organisation; manipulating and storing the information on which the \norganisation depends for its survival. The role of IT in corporate governance, in that case, has \nbecome more clearly defined, and IT governance is increasingly recognised as a specific area for \nboard and corporate attention.\n\nThe information security standards\n\nThe ISO 27000 family of standards overs a set of specifications, codes of conduct and best-practice \nguidelines for organisations to ensure strong information security management. Of primary interest \nare ISO 27001 and ISO 27002.\n\nISO 27001 is a technology-neutral, vendor- neutral information security management standard, but it \nis not a guide. Of the above standards for IT security governance, ISO 27001 offers the \nspecification: a prescription of the features of an effective information security management \nsystem.\n\nAs the specification, ISO 27001 states what is expected of an ISMS. This means that, in order to \nreceive certification or to pass an audit, your ISMS must conform to these requirements.\n\nWhile ISO 27001 offers the specification, ISO 27002 provides the code of conduct\n— guidance and recommended best practices that can be used to enforce the specification. ISO 27002, \nthen, is the source of guidance for the selection and implementation of an effective ISMS. In \nelect, ISO 27002 is the second part of ISO 27001.\n\nThese information security standards are the essential starting point for any organisation \ncommencing an information security project. Anyone contemplating such a project should purchase and \nstudy copies of ISO 27001 and ISO 27002.\n\nSee the ‘IT Governance solutions’ section at the end of this paper for additional resources and \nmaterials.\n\nInformation security and the regulatory\nenvironment\n\nThe two key reasons for the growing interest in certification to ISO 27001 are the proliferation of \nthreats to information (‘cyber threats’) and the growing range of regulatory and statutory \nrequirements that relate to information protection.\n\nInformation security threats are plobal in nature, and indiscriminately tarpet every organisation \nand individual who owns or uses (primarily) electronic information.\nThese threats are automated and loose on the Internet. Data is also exposed to many other dangers, \nsuch as acts of nature, external attack, and internal corruption and theft.\n\nThe last twenty years have seen the emergence of a growing body of legislation and regulation \naround information and data security. Some such regulations focus upon the protection of individual \ndata, while others aim at corporate financial, operational and risk management systems.\n\nA formal information security management system that provides guidance for the deployment of best \npractice is increasingly seen as a necessity in terms\nof compliance, and certification is increasingly required of organisations (and governments) before \nthey will be engaged in any significant commercial transactions.\n\nInternational recognition\n\nIn the United Kingdom, accreditation  of certifying bodies is handled by the United Kingdom \nAccreditation Service (UKAS), which maintains a list of all organisations qualified to certify ISO \n27001. Through a number of agreements with other international bodies, a certification in the UK is \nrecognised across the globe.\n\nIT GOVERNANCE                          JANUARY 2018\n\n\nThe European Cooperation for Accreditation (EA) is comprised of 35 national accreditation bodies \nacross Europe (including several associate members further afield). The EA multilateral agreement \naffirms:\n\n•     The equivalence of the operation of the accreditation systems administered  by EA members; \nand\n•     That the certificates and reports issued by organisations accredited by EA members are \nequally reliable.'\n\nThis means that certification approved by one member of the EA is accepted across all other member \nstates.\n\nISO 27001 is not only recognised throughout the EU, but also has a broader appeal in other key \nmarkets via the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). The IAF ensures that ISO 27001 \ncertification is recognised across the world through a ’mutual recognition arrangement’,  agreed by \nmore than 70 national accreditation bodies.\n\nMarket value of certification\n\nIn addition to protecting your data and complying with data handling laws like the GDPR, there is a \ndistinct market value to ISO 27001 certification. It is financially prudent to protect your \norganisation's data and to meet the legal requirements of nations in which you seek to do business.\n\nAchieving certification is a valuable and visible proof of your organisation's willingness to meet \ninternationally accepted data security standards. Achieving this international standard is not \nsimply marketing: as well as complying with the GDPR and other related laws such as those aligned \nwith the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive), the ability to \nprove that your\norganisation complies with ISO 27001 is likely to open business opportunities across the globe.\n\nIt should be noted that many markets have already shown a desire for ISO 27001 certification, with \nover 33,000 organisations worldwide having received certification.2\n\nhttp://www.european-accreditation.org/benefits.\nISO Survey  201 d, https://www.iso.org/the-iso-survey.latin .\n\n4\n\n\nThe argument for deploying a formal ISMS is fully developed in a short book called The Case for \nISO27001.\n\nCertification vs conformance\n\nIt is possible for an organisation to select controls and follow the guidance from ISO 27002 \nbecause the good practice identified is universally applicable. Because it was not designed to be \nthe basis of a certification scheme, however, it does not\nspecify the system requirements with which an ISMS must comply in order to qualify for \ncertification.\n\nThose specifications are contained in ISO 27001. In technical terms, this means that an \norganisation that is using ISO 27002 on its own can conform to the guidance of the code of \npractice, but it cannot get an outside body to verify that it is complying with a standard. An \norganisation that is using ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 in conjunction with one another can design an \nISMS that is in line with the specification and follows the guidance of the code of practice and \nis, therefore, capable of achieving external certification.\n\nIn order to achieve internationally recognised certification, your ISMS must be audited by an \norganisation approved by the appropriate body associated with the EA and IAF (in the UK, this is \nUKAS). Furthermore, the auditing organisation cannot be your consultant — their whole involvement \nin your ISMS must be limited to their audit.\n\nCertification and other management  standards\n\nISO 27001 is designed to be compatible with a number of other management system standards, such as \nISO 9001 (quality management) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) that follow what is called \nAnnex SL —a standardised structure for management system standards. The numbering systems and \ndocument management requirements are designed to be compatible, and thus enable organisations to \ndevelop management systems that inte  rate the requirements of each standard an organisation may be \nusing. ISO 27001 +s also generally compatible\n\nIT GOVERNANCE\nJANUARY 2018                                                                                        \n                                                                                               5\n\n\n\nwith ISO 31000 and ISO 20000.\n\nGenerally speaking, organisations should seek ISO 27001 certification from the certification body \nthey currently use for certifying their ISO 9001 or other\nmanagement system. The experience of the organisation's quality manager in this process will be \ninvaluable to the ISMS project.\n\nThere is no reason, however, why organisations shouldn't tackle ISO 27001 without having first \nimplemented another form of management  system. In that case, they will choose a certification body \non a commercial basis from among those available and operating in their country.\n\nMost countries have their own accreditation services that maintain lists of the organisations that \nare accredited for ISMS certifications.\n\nInformation  security and technology\n\nMost people think of information security as a technology issue. They think that anything to do \nwith securing data or protecting computers from threats is something that onIy technological  \nspecialists — and specifically computer security professionals\n— can deal with.\n\nThis could not be further from the truth.\n\nIt is the computer user who should decide which threats are to be protected from, and what \ntrade-offs between security and flexibility he or she is prepared to accept. Yes, once these \ndecisions have been made, the computer security expert should design and implement a technological  \nsolution that delivers these results — but they should operate according to the user‘s risk \nassessment.\n\nIn an organisational environment, those decisions should be made by the management team, not the IT \nteam. An ISMS overtly and specifically recognises that decision-making responsibility should sit \nwith the organisation's management, and that the ISMS should reflect their choices and provide \nevidence as to how effective the implementation has been.\n\n\nAs a result, it is not necessary for an ISMS project to be led by a technology expert. In fact, \nthere are many circumstances  in which that could be counter-productive.\nThese projects are often led by quality managers, general managers, or other executives who are in \na position to develop something that has an organisation- wide influence and importance.\n\nPreparing for an ISMS project and the continual improvement cycle\n\nAn ISMS project can be a complex one. It is likely to encompass the entire organisation, and should \ninvolve everyone from management down to the post room. Implementation may well take many months \nor, in some cases, years.\n\nISO 27001:2013 offers a structured approach to developing the ISMS. The clauses describe the \nrequirements of the ISMS, and Annex A provides controls that can be used to protect the \norganisation's information assets. There are no mandated stages to the project, but you need to \napply a continual improvement  process from the outset; the PDCA cycle (see info box below) is one \npossible methodology.\n\nThe process, or an improvement to the process, should first be planned, then implemented and its \nperformance measured. By comparing these measurements against the planned specification, you will \nbe able to identify any deviations or potential improvements. These can then be reported to \nmanagement for a decision regarding the correct action to take.\n\nIT GOVERNANCE                           JANUARY 2018\n\n\nRisk assessment and risk treatment plans\n\nn ISMS must be designed within the context of and to meet the individual requirements of each \norganisation. Not only does every organisation have its own specific business model, objectives, \nunique selling features and culture, it also has its diñerent appetites for risk. In other words, \nsomething that one organisation sees as a threat that it must deflect, another mipht see as an \nopportunity that it should grasp.\n\nSimilarly, one organisation  may be less prepared to invest in defences against an identified risk \nthan another.  For this and other reasons, every organisation  that implements  an ISMS must do so \nagainst the results of a risk assessment  whose methodology, findings and recommendations have been \napproved by the board of directors.\n\nISO 27001, in fact, requires a risk assessment to be carried out and, while it does not specify a \nmethodology, it is very clear that this risk assessment must produce consistent, valid and \ncomparable results, and analyse and assess the risks.\n\nSystem documentation\n\nhe most time-consuming part of the entire project is the development  of the documentation that \nsets out how the ISMS works.\n\n\nThere are a number of different approaches to this, from using external consultants to tackling it \nyourself. The major argument in favour of doing it yourself (apart from avoiding, or reducing, \nconsultancy costs) is that you will develop a much greater depth and awareness of ’how to do \nsecurity’.  By developing  such expertise  and experience within the organisation, any further such \nprojects can be dealt with more quickly and with a greater degree of confidence.\n\nWithout previous experience, development of all the documentation required can be a daunting task. \nThe templates contained in the ISO/IEC 27001 Complete ISMS  T      it   ill save you hours of \ndrafting and will help you to avoid trial and error dead ends.\n\n\npeak to an expert\n\nIT GOVERNANCE                          JANUARY 2018\n\n\nUseful ISO 27001 resources\n\n\nISO 27001 bespoke consultancy\n\nIT Governance has helped over 400 companies successfully implement an ISO 27001 ISMS.
